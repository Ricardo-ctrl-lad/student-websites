            <p2>Labubu is a plush toy character created by Hong Kong designer Kasing Lung and introduced in 2015. Featuring a playful yet slightly fierce appearance—a round, furry body, wide eyes, pointed ears, and sharp teeth forming a mischievous smile—Labubu has gained significant popularity, especially among adult collectors. In 2019, Pop Mart began producing Labubu toys in various colors, shapes, and sizes, including plush and vinyl figures. The brand experienced a surge in demand in 2024, partly due to celebrity endorsements, notably from Blackpink's Lisa.</p2>
