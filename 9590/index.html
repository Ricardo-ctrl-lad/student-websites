            <p2>The Gravedigger would kidnap victims for a ransom but with a sick twist. She would place them in a container underground with only enough air for 12 hours and if the ransom was not paid their location would never be found. After the team got too closde to catching her, she kidnapped Temperance and one of he team, Jack Hodgins. She was active for years and infamous but she was eventually caught after wreaking more havoc. She was killed however by a vigilante sniper killer known as Jacob Broadsky, who trained Booth to be a marine sniper, starting off the hunt for him. </p2>

            <p2>Gormogon while arguably the most horrific is also possibly the most referred to killer in the entire series with a case stretching over multiple seasons. In a deep conspiracy theory based group with cannabilistic tendencies, teacher-mentor killing partners gowing back generations whwere comitting atrocious acts. They were only discovered to be active after a coincedental discovery of a skull. This case infected one of Brennan's own team, Dr. Zack Addy, in an emotion rollercoaster of an episode.</p2>

                <p2>Bones has a deep focus on exploring the dark side of crime and the sadistic wants of most serial killers while also exploring more humanitarian justifications for murder such as thwe classic envy motive. Bones is viewe as one of the major forensic shows to this day and is the legacy of the first remarkeable and rewarded female forensic scientist. This show feautures all sides to crime solving and still incorporates romance and humour.</p2>
