                <p2>During the show, Marinette struggles with stress of being a hero and keeping her identity and
                    secrets
                    unknown. She attends Collège Françoise Dupont where she finally stands up to her bully and
                    manipulator: Chloé Bourgeois, spouiled and unloved daughter of the Mayor of Paris. During her time
                    at school, she developes feelings for Adrien Agreste. who she sees as kind and incredibly
                    compassionate. Adrien, however, only sees Marinette as a friend, but little did Marinette know that
                    Adrien ahas never had friends before, it is a new concept, and having a friend means so much to him.
                    Adrien, having convinced his father to allow him to join school instead of home schooling, is still
                    mapping around school life and social interactions. Chloe, his only childhgood friend, is obsessed
                    with Adrien, though he dislikes the terrble way she treats others. </p2>

                <p2>In season 2, Marinette comes across a shocking realisation that she had come in possession of this
                    strange Mirculous - not by chance, but by choice. There are more Miraculouses that contain powers
                    unheard of that are protectd by Guardian. She then meets the Guardian - Master Fu - and theres more
                    to him than he seems, a backstory as traqgic as it is sad of he came in possession of the Miracuous
                    box. Another striking realisation is then made; two of the miraculouses are missing, the miraculous
                    of the Butterfly and the miraculous of the Moth. He reveals that Hawthmoth is in possession of
                    atleast one of them, and is using his miraculous for terribly evil and greedy desires.</p2>

                <p2>As the show progresses across the years and seasons, it gradually becomes less of a kids show and
                    more of a complex cinematic experience with interesting plot changes and twists. Marinette grows
                    older, more mature, more stronger the longer she is in possession of her miraculous, she builds a
                    sense of responsibilty and uses her wit and cleverness to formulate plans to outsmart her opponents.
                    Marinette is both mentally and physically strong, and learns to wield and combine and unify many
                    miraculouses as a time, and in the episode "Kwamibuster," which is a pivotal turning point to the
                    series, she uses all of them in order to get her miraculous back from Hawkmoth's akumnatised
                    villain. Hawkmoth, has also become more and more intelligent as time wears on, and at some points,
                    ventures out of Paris and akumatises volatile machines and other super heros. At this moment i time,
                    Master Fu realises how strong Marinette is, how the weight of the entire universe rests on a
                    highschooler's shoulders, how responsibily she is dealing with everything, how formidable of a
                    person she is. <iframe style="border-radius:12px"
