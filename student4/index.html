            <p2> In this film adaptation of the book, 'War Horse', Tom Hiddleston plays the role of 'Captain James Nicholls'. Of course, like any role Tom Hiddleston plays, it was an amazing performance. Tom Hiddleston + horses = GOLD! His character, of course, plays the hero of the story and ends up being the character you will remember after watching the film. In an interview Tom was asked how he prepared for the role, Tom relied with, 'I filled myself up on horse films. I watched Seabiscuit, The Horse Whisperer, Charge of the Light Brigade and Waterloo'. You can watch 'War Horse' on Amazon Prime video from £3.49, or YouTube from £9.99. P.S - IT'S WORTH IT!</p2>

            <p2> Unfortunately, Tom was only in one 'Kong' movie, but I think that just means this 'Kong' movie, is the best. Tom Hiddleston plays the role of, 'Captain James Conrad', not to be confused with his previous character,'Captain James Nicholls'. His character in Kong: Skull Island, is an ex-British Special Air Service Captain who served in the Vietnam War with the Australian Special Air Service Regiment that Randa hires as a hunter-tracker for the expedition. Hiddleston described his character as a man who holds "no political allegiance in the conflict" but "understands conflict." He further states, "He's a former soldier who has been formed by an understanding of war, but his specific skill set is something that's attached to the power of nature; and I think that's something people haven't seen in a long time." You can watch 'Kong: Skull Island' on Amazon prime video with a subscription. </p2>

            <p2> 'Thor: The Dark world' was Tom's third time played the God of Mischief, 'Loki'. On where he wished to take the character in the film, Hiddleston said, "I'd like to take Loki to his absolute rock bottom. I'd like to see him yield, essentially, to his darkest instincts. Then, having hit rock bottom, maybe come back up. I think the fascination for me about playing Loki is that, in the history of the mythology and the comic books and the Scandinavian myths, is he's constantly dancing on this fault line of the dark side and redemption."

            <p2>Though Loki wasn't the main part of the film, he sure was still one of the most significant. *SPOILER UPCOMING!!!* In an interview, Hiddleston said he knew about Loki's death in Infinity War prior to production of Thor: Ragnarok after meeting the Russos in May 2016, with his death being the first scene of the film that the Russos had conceptualized. Hiddleston's knowledge of Loki's fate in Infinity War influenced his portrayal in Ragnarok. On Loki's final moments, Hiddleston believed it was "very powerful" that Loki calls himself "Odinson", as it was a moment that "closes the whole journey of Loki", while his death "takes the stakes up dramatically", establishing the threat of Thanos. After Infinity War, Tom was upset as he believed this was the last time he would get to play Loki. Little did he know, Loki was NOT finished! You can watch 'Avengers: Infinity War' on Disney +</p2>

            <p2> 'Thor' was Hiddleston's Loki and Marvel big debut. Tom actually originally auditioned for Thor, thinking his height and blondish hair would fit the look, however he quickly learned he was more suited to play the trickster god, Loki. Tom was invited to audition by Kenneth Branagh, the film's director, after having previously worked with Branagh on Ivanov and Wallander. Hiddleston stated that the character was "a comic book version of Edmund in King Lear, but nastier." Hiddleston had to keep a strict diet before the start of filming because Branagh wanted "Loki to have a lean and hungry look, like Cassius in Julius Caesar. You can watch 'Thor' on Disney + </p2>

            <p2> 'Thor: Ragnarok' was Hiddleston's fourth movie playing the role of Loki. Hiddleston was interested in how Loki's attitude has changed, saying, "he is always a trickster. It is trying to find new ways for him to be mischievous". As the ruler of Asgard since the end of Thor: The Dark World (2013), Hiddleston notes that "Loki has devoted most of his efforts to narcissistic self-glorification. Not so much on good governance." He also added that "the idea that Thor might be indifferent to Loki is troubling for him... it's an interesting development.' You can watch 'Thor: Ragnarok'
