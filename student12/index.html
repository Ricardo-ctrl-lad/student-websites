                    <p2>The Legend Of Zelda: Breath of The Wild is a compelling story, which touches on the concept of love, loss
                        ,acceptence and the fear of being forgotten. Not only does it have one of the best storylines, the game is 
                        open-world,allowing you to explore at your own pace. The game allows you to find things out for yourself, while still
                        providing tips to guide you through the vast terrain. The scenery is beautiful and the music adds to the atmosphere,blending 
                        in seamlessly, while creating a unique way of conveying emotions.

                                <p2>The Legend Of zelda: Twilight Princess is a one of zelda's more darker games. It's world is dark and barron,covered by a
                                    glimpse of twilight. The game touches on the feeling of loosing a friend, and the consequences of scarifce. The music is intense and 
                                    and loud, which allows the game to have such a dark atmosphere. There are many scences that will leave the player shocked. The game finishes with
                                    a plot twist that not many expect.
