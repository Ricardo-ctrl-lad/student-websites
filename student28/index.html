                <p>Not only are they fluffy and adorable, Persian cats tend to be cuddly and friendly. When it comes to
                    fuzzy kittens, the Persian is one of the most popular cats. You'll often find them patiently waiting
                    for you to sit down so they can find their comfortable spot right on your lap. Once the petting
                    session is over, they'll be able to steal your heart just by sitting quietly and looking adorable.

    <!-- Maine Coon Cat -->
    <div class="callout-item">

            <div class="callout-description">
                <p>The Maine Coon manages being the loyal companion you expect from a friendly cat breed while keeping
                    their independent streak. Despite their big physique, they love nothing more than a good cuddle in
                    your lap. The Maine Coon is a very intelligent cat, so keep the toy box topped up with plenty of
                    puzzle toys; nothing spells fun for these kittens more than a good mental challenge.</p>

    </div> <!-- Exotic Shorthair -->

            </div>
            <div class="callout-description">
                <p>The Exotic is closely related to the Persian and therefore borrows a lot of their quiet and sweet
                    nature. They are known to love play time a bit more than a Persian and have considerably shorter
                    hair, making it easier to manage their grooming schedule. If you are looking for a loyal
                    companion, the Exotic is one of the most affectionate cat breeds you can welcome into your life.

                <p>If you are looking for a social feline that loves a good chat, you will look forward spending time
                    with a Siamese. These kittens know how to make their presence felt with their boisterous
                    personality. They are beautiful and intelligent,and are also quite fond of humans. But be aware that
                    they are not too keen on being left home alone - they need to be with family or at least with
                    another fellow Siamese to be happy kittens.
