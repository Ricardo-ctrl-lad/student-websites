            <p2> The start of a thrilling fantasy series from bestselling author Holly Black about Jude Duarte,
                seventeen and mortal, who finds herself caught tangled in palace intrigues while trying to win a place
                in the treacherous High Court of Faerie, where she and her sisters have lived for ten years. I absolutly
                loved this series as it had crazy plot twists and character development, its a sort of cutthroat violent
                book with romance as a sub-plot.
