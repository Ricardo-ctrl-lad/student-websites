                        <p2>Labubus are a type of plush toy character that gained popularity through their cute, quirky,
                            and customizable design. The name "Labubu" comes from a blend of “love” and “bubu,” which
                            means “cutie” in some languages, reflecting their adorable nature. These creatures started
                            as a small project by a designer or artist who wanted to create something unique and fun for
                            people to collect and personalize. The labubus were first introduced in online markets or at
                            conventions, where their wide range of colors, designs, and sizes quickly attracted fans.
                            Over time, they have evolved into a cultural phenomenon, often seen in various media and art
                            forms, becoming beloved by collectors and enthusiasts alike.
